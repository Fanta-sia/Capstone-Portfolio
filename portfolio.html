        <h1>02 Digital Bakery</h1>
        <h3>The focus here was on program design, style, and user experience using tkinter. A real ordering platform needs to be error-proof and user-friendly, which I aimed to achieve in this project. My partner and I worked together on this; he designed the buttons while I organized them within different frames. I was responsible for writing the functions for the buttons, while he proofread my code. We collaborated on creating a custom tip frame, with him handling the button design and me focusing on the logic for the tip frame.</h3>

        <h3>In this viginere cipher program, the focus here is tinkering with different methods. It took me a couple of days to finish because I got stuck in making the code of moving individual characters by the corresponding character of the key. After reviewing the slides, I figured out a different way to approach the problem, so I included two solutions for each part.</h3>
